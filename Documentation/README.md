### Background
* This document describes the BCF format that is used to exchange topics, such as, issues, scenes, etc. between different BIM software.

### BCF file structure
A BCF file is a zip containing one folder for each topic with its file extension "bcfzip" for BCFv1.0 and BCFv2.0. The file extension as the version number "bcfv2.1" is introduced since BCFv2.1.
The root of the BCF zip contains the following files.

* project.bcfp (optional)
    - An XML file referencing the extension.xsd to a project. The schema for this file is project.xsd.
* bcf.version
	* An XML file following the version.xsd schema with information of the BCF schema used. The file content should be identical to the contents of [bcf.version](bcf.version "bcf.version")

The folder name is the GUID of the topic. This GUID is in the UUID form. The folder contains the following files:

* markup.bcf
    * An XML file following the markup.xsd schema that is described below.
* viewpoint.bcfv
    * An XML file following the visinfo.xsd schema that is described below.
    * Multiple viewpoints are possible since BCF 2.0. Names of these files are not predefined. Note: One viewpoint needs to be be named viewpoint.bcfv even in the case of multiple viewpoints.
* snapshot.png 
    *  A snapshot related to the topic (for compatibility with BCF 1.0).
Multiple snapshots are possible since BCF 2.0. Names of these files are not predefined. Note: One snapshot needs to be named snapshot.png even in the case of multiple viewpoints.


*Note: The elements in the XML files must appear in the order given in the schemas and described below.*

Viewpoints are immutable, therefore they should never be changed once created. If new comments on a topic require different visualization, new viewpoints should be added.

## Visualization information (.bcfv) file
The visualization information file contains information of components related to the topic, camera settings, and possible markup and clipping information.

### Components
Component references are divided into 4 sets:

Name | Description |  
:-----------|:------------
components | List of physical components. That means components that are not of type IfcSpace, IfcSpaceBoundary or IfcOpening.
Spaces | List of components with type IfcSpace.
SpaceBoundaries | List of components with type IfcSpaceBoundary.
Openings | List of components with type IfcOpening.

The components node contains a set of Component references. The numeric values in this file are all given in fixed units (meters for length and degrees for angle). Unit conversion is not required, since the values are not relevant to the user. The components node has also the DefaultVisibility attribute which indicates true or false for all components of the viewpoint.

A component has the following attributes:

Attribute | Optional | Description |  
:-----------|:------------|:------------
IfcGuid | Yes | Select the component in a BIM tool
Selected | Yes | This flag is true if the component is actually involved in the topic. If the flag is false, the component is involved as reference.
Visible | Yes | This flag is true when the component is visible in the visualization. By setting this false, you can hide components that would prevent seeing the topic from the camera position and angle of the viewpoint.
Color | Yes | Color of the component. This can be used to provide special highlighting of components in the viewpoint. The color is given in ARGB format.


In addition, it has the following information:

Element | Optional | Description |  
:-----------|:------------|:------------
OriginatingSystem | Yes | Name of the system in which the component is originated
AuthoringToolId | Yes | System specific identifier of the component in the originating BIM tool

#### Exporting Components in Viewpoint

There can be lots of component references in a viewpoint. Therefore, these references must be kept to a minimum. The following rules are developed to export the components in compact and unambiguous way.

The components in viewpoints are exported according to  the following rules:
Divide all components to the following sets: **Openings**, **Spaces**, **SpaceBoundaries**, and **Components**.

- **Components** are physical building components, such as walls and doors.

- **Spaces** are the rooms in the building.

- **Openings** are the virtual elements modeling voids in components.

- **SpaceBoundaries** are the virtual elements between spaces and building components, such as, walls and doors.

For each set of sets above, divide them further to the following subsets:

**V**: Visible components
**I**: Invisible components
**S**: Selected or colored components, subset of V

Apply the following rules for **Components**, **Spaces**, **Openings**, **SpaceBoundaries**

For components

1. If **I** is empty and **S** equals **V** 

	a) Export **S** with DefaultVisibility=true

	b) Set visible=true for all components in **S**

2. If **V** is smaller than **I**

	a) Export **V** with DefaultVisibility=false

	b) Set visible=true for all components in **V**

3. Else

	a) Export **I** and **S** with DefaultVisibility=true

	b) Set visible=true for all components in **S**

	c) Set visible=false for all components in **I**

### OrthogonalCamera (optional)
This element describes a viewpoint using orthogonal camera. It has the following elements:

Element | Optional | Description |  
:-----------|:------------|:------------
CameraViewPoint | No | Camera location
CameraDirection | No | Camera direction
CameraUpVector | No | Camera up vector
ViewToWorldScale | No | Scaling from view to world

### PerspectiveCamera (optional)
This element describes a viewpoint using perspective camera. It has the following 

Element | Optional | Description |  
:-----------|:------------|:------------
CameraViewPoint | No | Camera location
CameraDirection | No | Camera direction
CameraUpVector | No | Camera up vector
FieldOfView | No | Camera’s field of view angle in degrees.

### Lines (optional)
Lines can be used to add markup in 3D. Each line is defined by three dimensional Start Point and End Point.

### ClippingPlanes (optional)
ClippingPlanes can be used to define a subsection of a building model that is related to the topic. Each clipping plane is defined by Location and Direction.

### Bitmap (optional)
A list of bitmaps can be used to add more information, for example, text in the visualization. It has the following elements:


Element | Optional | Description |  
:-----------|:------------|:------------
Bitmap | No | Format of the bitmap (PNG/JPG)
Reference | No | Name of the bitmap file in the topic folder
Location | No | Location of the center of the bitmap in world coordinates
Normal | No | Normal vector of the bitmap
Up | No | Up vector of the bitmap

## Implementation Agreements 
Since BCF 2.0 is compatible with version 1.0, there are some ambiguities in the implementation. The following agreements are written to clarify the implementation.

### One to Many Mapping between Viewpoints and Comments
The schema would allow to have many to many mapping between viewpoints and comments. This is not allowed. A viewpoint can have multiple comments, but a comment can only refer to one viewpoint.

### Status and VerbalStatus to be Phased out
Status and Verbal Status of Comment will be phased out and replaced by TopicStatus and TopicType in Topic. 

When interpreting BCF 1.0 files use the following logic:

- use Status of most recent comment as value of TopicType
- use Verbalstatus of most recent comment as TopicStatus.

When interpreting BCF 2.0 or higher files: VerbalStatus and Status on comment level should all be neglected if TopicStatus and TopicType are present in Topic.

When writing BCF 2.0 or higher files:

- write the current type and status to Topic's TopicType and TopicStatus
- write Status and VerbalStatus at Comment level for backward compatibility.

### .BCFZIP encoding guide
 
Software tool vendors are encouraged to follow the following guidelines to ensure that the .BCFZIP files produced by their software can be correctly exchanged with other tools.

####  Use forward slash as path separator

The forward slash (“/”) should be used as a path separator rather than the backslash (“\”). Windows developers should consult the following MSDN page when attempting to follow this guideline: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt712573(v=vs.110).aspx


| Correct |  Incorrect |
|---------|------------|
| `742b0df3-9a99-4da3-95ad-171e282f8122/snapshot.png` |  `742b0df3-9a99-4da3-95ad-171e282f8122\snapshot.png` |

#### Create directory (folder) entries in the zip file's central directory

When creating the zip archive make sure to create directory (folder) entries in the .BCFZIP file’s central directory.
